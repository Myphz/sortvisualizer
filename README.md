# Welcome to Sort Visualizer!
https://www.sortvisualizer.com  
**Sort Visualizer** is a web application designed to better understand sorting algorithms by displaying and visualizing them.
In the website you can find information and implementations in multiple programming languages of more than 15 sorting algorithms, categorized by their time and space complexity.

## The sorting algorithms currently available are:
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Shaker Sort
- Odd Even Sort
- Pancake Sort
- Bitonic Sort
- Radix Sort
- Shell Sort
- Comb Sort
- Bogo Sort

## Custom Sort
It's also possible to design and visualize *your own sorting algorithm*, using the [documented APIs](https://www.sortvisualizer.com/docs). Have fun messing around and trying new stuff!

## Notes
This website has been made using purely vanilla JS, HTML, CSS and Flask.

Shell Sort

{% block info %}
<p data-aos="fade-right">
Shell Sort is one of the oldest sorting algorithms and it's an extension of the <a href="/insertionsort">Insertion Sort</a>. This algorithm is fast and easy to implement, but it's hard to measure its performances.
</p>
<p data-aos="fade-right">
Unlike Insertion Sort, Shell Sort starts by comparing the elements distant from each other by a certain gap that gets progressively decreased. By starting with the most distant elements, it can optimize performances
as it's not limited by just comparing two adjacent elements.

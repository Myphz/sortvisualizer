Comb Sort
{% endblock %}

{% block info %}
<p data-aos="fade-right">
Comb Sort is a sorting algorithm really similar to <a href="/bubblesort">Bubble Sort</a>. It highly improves its performances by removing the "turtles", that is the small elements placed near the end of the data structure that slows down
a lot the performances of Bubble Sort.
</p>
<p data-aos="fade-right">
Bubble Sort is based on comparing adjacent elements, so with a distance of 1. Comb Sort increases this distance using a shrink factor <var>k</var> (usually with a value of 1.3).
Initially, the distance has a value of <var>n</var>. For each iteration, a Bubble Sort gets executed using the new distance value instead of 1. The distance gets progressively divided by the shrink factor <var>k</var>.
</p>
<p data-aos="fade-right">
This procedure gets executed until the distance reaches the value of 1. At this point, the algorithm is a regular Bubble Sort, but the majority of the "turtles" already got removed.
</p>
<p data-aos="fade-right">
Its average time complexity depends, in addition to the number of elements of the data structure, by a value  <var>p</var>, representing the number of divisions carried out.

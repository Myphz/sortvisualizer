{% block info %}
<p data-aos="fade-right">
The Shaker Sort, also called the Cocktail Shaker Sort, is an extension of the <a href="/bubblesort">Bubble Sort</a>.
Unlike the Bubble Sort, which puts the greater element to the end of the non-ordered structure part at each cycle,
the Shaker Sort alternates the cycles in which it brings the greater element of the non-ordered structure part to the end of the ordered part
and cycles in which leads the minor element of the unsorted part of the structure at the beginning of the ordered part.
</p>
<p data-aos="fade-right">
The Shaker Sort alternates two Bubble Sorts, the first that sorts the structure
starting from the largest element ordering the elements down to the smallest,
and one that starts from the smallest element and sorts the elements up to the largest.
Although this algorithm is an extension of the Bubble Sort and at first glance it might seem much more efficient,
the performance increase is minimal and the complexity is the same.
